      <p>I am attempting to learn the fundamentals of HTML in 30 days by building this website with 30 pages each including a new element or feature on each page. I am expecting that some of these pages will take less than a day and others more that one day to complete. I do not have ready access to a pc, so if you are on a pc and this site looks a little funny that my be why. This attempt is the basic site including a web based HTML font. I will also include links to the sites that I found perticularly useful in learning each element.</p> <p>Day 1: My first day at work was designing this main page. The first steps were to choose the coloring and page design. I downloaded the font Fontin Sans font and using the steps from the site FontFace.com was able to add the online font to this site. I did additional work on this page on day two while learning how to float objects on this main page. The example of float will be displayed on page two.
